# End-to-End Chatbot

## Overview
An end-to-end chatbot is a fully automated conversational agent that can handle complete user interactions without human intervention. This chatbot is built using Python and leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) to understand user requests, generate responses, and take necessary actions. The chatbot is deployed on Streamlit Cloud for easy accessibility.

## Features
- Handles entire conversations autonomously
- Understands user queries and provides relevant responses
- Trained on predefined intents
- Deployable on Streamlit Cloud for easy access

## Steps to Build the Chatbot
1. **Define Intents**: Identify and categorize the types of queries the chatbot should handle.
2. **Create Training Data**: Prepare a dataset containing sample user queries and corresponding responses.
3. **Train the Chatbot**: Use NLP techniques to train the chatbot to understand and respond effectively.
4. **Build the Chatbot**: Implement the chatbot logic using Python.
5. **Test the Chatbot**: Ensure the chatbot performs well across various test cases.
6. **Deploy the Chatbot**: Host the chatbot on Streamlit Cloud for users to access.

## Deployment
The chatbot is deployed on Streamlit Cloud and can be accessed using the following link:

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Core programming language
- **TensorFlow/Keras**: For training the chatbot (if deep learning is used)
- **NLTK / spaCy**: For Natural Language Processing
- **Streamlit**: For deploying and hosting the chatbot

## How to Run Locally
1. Clone this repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/chatbot.git
   cd chatbot
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the chatbot locally:
   ```sh
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

## Future Improvements
- Improve response accuracy with more training data
- Integrate with external APIs for more dynamic interactions
- Deploy as a web service for broader accessibility
